<h1>Reinventing Zero</h1>

<h2>Back to the basics of: 
The significance of zero and one, and also an abbreviated way of counting almost anything</h2>

<p>This observation is similar to straightening out a picture hanging on a wall.</p>

<p>First of all, does zero exist or is it the void? In this talk, void will equal empty space.
Defined as nothing, does zero exist? Defined as a positional notation which denotes place value
in a counting system&mdash; zero does exist. As a numeral character, zero does exist between negative
one and positive one.</p>

<p>How do we solve this so-called dilemma?</p>

<p>Hence the discovery of and man&rsquo;s graphic invention of zero:
Zero comes into being when we construct an abstract globe to encapsulate empty space.
Since we write in two dimensions, a circle shows this encapsulation.
Being that everything is relative, according to Einstein&rsquo;s theory, every zero is relative to another integer.
Why not use zeroes as containers to hold the integers? Therefore, zero will then also exist as a container.</p>

<p>Second of all, it is obvious that integers exist. In order to count existing integers,
abstract or concrete, we must have a location. A mathematician once said, &ldquo;God gave us void
and existence (zero and one); all the rest is the work of man.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Man&rsquo;s invention of the base-ten counting system</h3>

<p>Just about everyone knows that the base-ten system originated from the ten fingers (digits) of our hands.
However, most of our European ancestors started counting from one. The significance of zero was, for the most part,
unknown. The main purpose of zero was and still is to identify the place value in the system.</p>

<h3>The modification of the base-ten counting system: How I think we should orally and visually count</h3>

<p>This observation happened while I was counting my steps as I was exercising on a treadmill. I asked the question: why do we say seventeen when the ten should come first and the seven second? Then I thought, why not say one-seven, and then also, why not say, for example, two-three instead of twenty-three, etc. This seemed to say &ldquo;tell it and see it&rdquo; as it really is. Further along in my observation I thought we are orally counting in too many syllables. For example, don&rsquo;t say zero. Say the alphabet letter, &ldquo;o&rdquo;. Although zero has several names, it is best to say the letter &ldquo;o&rdquo; when counting, simply because it&rsquo;s one syllable, easy to say and is also the same visually. It can be considered a homonym.</p>

<p>Zero as a container can hold the numerical characters zero through nine. Zero, the place marker, now becomes the unit&rsquo;s container. It follows then that zeroes as place markers can be used to hold the groups of &ldquo;tens, hundreds, thousands,&rdquo; etc. The beauty of zero is that it has no material value and it has infinite uses as a maximum volume container. It is also the beginning!</p>

<p>When counting, say or visualize the individual characters starting with &ldquo;o&rdquo;. Picture them going into a zero container/place marker. We commonly speak numbers in single digits. Again, for example: Your phone number, social security number, music timing and the winning ticket are all stated in single digits. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense to say, &ldquo;my phone number is seven billion two hundred forty-eight million, xxx thousand xxx hundred.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I state my case, from this point on, some things need to be said!</p>
